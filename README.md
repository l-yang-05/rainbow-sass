## SASS Buttons
This is was a fun exercise that I created for myself to get a better understanding on how to use SASS as well as experimenting around with different hover effects for buttons. I used SASS, Javascript, and JQuery to create all of the buttons and to add the special cursor effects. This website also scores 100 on web accessibility.
